# [js.uy](http://js.uy)

Links to the different JS communities in Uruguay.

## How I list my community here?

Submit a PR, once it's approved you should see your community listed on the site.

üíÅ Remember to check the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cherta/js.uy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## I run a Uruguayan JS community, can I have a js.uy domain?

Sure, the idea is to give the whole Uruguayan JS community a stronger image not to own anything so please [‚úâÔ∏è](mailto:hola@hs.uy) and I can add your A record to the Antel DNS.

## Future plans

- [ ] Onboard all JS communities
- [ ] Serve as a distribution hub (twitter, mailing list, etc)

## How to build this site

We use [hugo](http://gohugo.io/) a static site generator built with go, I'll need to [install it](http://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) before, after that just run `hugo` on the root folder of this repo.
