## About

Uruguay has great talent doing some awesome work but we fail miserably communicating that "awesomeness", most of the developers fail communicating their achievements, while others don't really care.

We built `*.js.uy` as a way to list and promote all the great things we are doing as a JS community in Uruguay.

We think that getting noticed and spreading the word of what we do would have a positive impact on the developers life by: reaching better clients, raising salaries and allowing people to work on projects they care about.

To summarize, our goals are:

* Help people to better market themselves
* Get noticed at an international level
* Put Uruguay in the map for the global JS community

### Why is this site in English?

Good question! We are trying to reach a global audience, and we think it will be really hard to do so if we don't use English as the main language of the page. Part of our goal is to better communicate what we do, having a site that's fully in English is a work on that direction.

Nevertheless we are working on a Spanish version.
